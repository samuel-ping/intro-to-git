                <h3>Steps in English</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>You create a repo.</li>
                    <li>When you make changes to your repository, you then <b>add</b> it to the staging area. You can do this as many times as you want.</li>
                    <li>Once you've added all of your modified files to the staging area, you <b>commit</b> those changes with a message stating what the changes are. You can only commit when there are files in the staging area that you added in the previous step. After committing, your files are removed from the staging area.</li>
                    <li>Once you've made your commit(s), you then <b>push</b> your changes to your repository. This is the part that actually updates the repository, whether it be hosted on GitHub or somewhere else.</li>
                    <li>Repeat steps 2-4 as necessary.</li>
